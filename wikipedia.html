        <p>Wikipedia is a multilingual online encyclopedia created and maintained as an open collaboration project by a community of volunteer editors using a wiki-based editing system. It is the largest and most popular general reference work on the World Wide Web, and is one of the most popular websites ranked by Alexa as of October 2019. It features exclusively free content and no commercial ads, and is owned and supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization funded primarily through donations. Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Sanger coined its name, as a portmanteau of "wiki" (the Hawaiian word for "quick") and "encyclopedia". While it was Initially an English-language encyclopedia, versions in other languages were quickly developed. With at least 5,969,381 articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 290 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 40 million articles in 301 different languages and by February 2014 it had reached 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors per month.

        Here is some brief history of Wikipedia and a few examples of how Wikipedia has changed global society:

              Wikipedia's current statistics</h2>
            <p class="card-text"> Wikipedia is a free Internet encyclopaedia that allows users to edit almost any article that is accessible. Wikipedia is the largest and most popular reference work on the Internet and is ranked among the ten most popular websites. Wikipedia is owned by the non-profit organisation Wikimedia foundation and today Wikipedia contains more than 40 million articles spread across 250 languages. As of 2014, it had 18 billion page views and 500 million unique visitors each month.</p>
            <p class="card-text">It all started with Ward Cunningham who invented a new website model called wiki. Wikis are webpages that allow users to edit and create content on their site in real time. They are generally present in a lot of websites to provide information to the website users. Cunningham’s only contribution to wikipedia was coining the term Wiki. In March of 2000, Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger decided that they wanted to create a free online encyclopaedia that would rival Microsoft’s Encarta and Brittanica. Wales and Sanger called their project Nupedia.com which was a for profit company that required articles to go through a strict peer review process before being published for public access. Contributors had to be experts in their fields and only PhD’s were preferred.</p>

            Nupedia
            </h2>
            <p class="card-text"> Nupedia hadn’t really picked up because finding experts to write articles and to peer review them was a very slow process. Wales and Sang used the ideology of wikis to create wikipedia in 2001 to let the public suggest and write content for potential articles that would be published in Nupedia. Unlike Nupedia, anyone could create, edit and discuss content on Wikipedia. But the lack of a good review process led to Nupedia’s death in 2003 and in its three year existence Nupedia had produced only 24 articles. </p>

            <p class="card-text"> By the time Nupedia was shut down, Wikipedia had produced 20,000 articles. Surprised by the success and popularity of wikipedia, Jimmy Wales abandoned the peer review model of Nupedia and went ahead with the anyone can edit model of Wikipedia. Larry Sanger did not approve of this and left the company.

Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in Wikipedia, Wales announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia’s domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org. The number of articles per day written kept rising until it was around 1800 per day in 2006. As more and more topics got covered, this number started flattening and then falling later to 800 in 2013. By this point, articles had already been created and built extensively on most of the topics. </p>

            Rivalry with Google
            </h2>
            <p class="card-text"> In 2015, Google wanted to grow along with Wikipedia by pulling information about popular personalities and display them as one of the search results. Google started displaying KnowledgeGraphs, a typical example being the list of details provided about a sportsperson when you search for him. They pulled the data from Wikipedia because any information available(except for images) in Wikipedia is allowed for the public to reuse. Today Google takes information from Wikipedia for a wide range of information and it is under constant scrutiny because the data may be incorrect or outdated. </p>
            <p class="card-text"> Wikipedia spends around 25 million $ each year with millions of hours contributed by volunteer writers and editors who leverage this modest budget. It is funded by donations into asset worth tens of billions of dollars that produces hundreds of billions of dollars of consumer benefit. This estimation is purely based on what other sites with similar traffic are worth and is something to consider the next time Jimmy Wales shows up asking you for money. </p>
