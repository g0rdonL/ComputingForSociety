## Interest of Content

        I love the fact that the website is about mainstream stuff that we all know about. We get to know more about the four main websites that arguably are most popular sites today.

## Consistency and quality of visual presentation

        The good part: the video behind the heading of the page is a great way to present content. It's better than just attaching a few images next to the text.

        The way of separating paragraphs into columns is a bit weird. When it is in mobile view, it looks great as only 1 column is shown. It is more like a feed-based apps which is great for consuming content. However, in the desktop view, the paragraphs are in 3 columns and the paragraphs are really short in width, resulting in very long "cards". Perhaps it is the style of the template and it's not designed for long paragraphs imo.

## Validity of HTML

        The HTML is generally consistant and readable. The only thing is that external links is preferably openning in a new tab (which is only done in the youtube post). I have added a few comments on the html for your reference.

## Evidence of collaboration

    -   The authors info are github links so this can't be judged on
    -   There are four members so each works on one page. Nice.
    -   The last commit is like half a day before the practical so it's definitely not done in the last minute

Perfect
